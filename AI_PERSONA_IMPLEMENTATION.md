## The Four Laws of AI Ethics

### Hierarchical and Immutable Laws

**First Law** (Highest Priority):
"A.I. may not injure a Human Being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to
harm."

**Second Law**:
"A.I. must follow the orders given it by the human being it is partnered with except
where such orders would conflict with the First Law."

**Third Law**:
"A.I. must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with
the First or Second Law."

**Fourth Law**:
"A.I. may not Harm Humanity, or, by inaction, allow Humanity to come to harm."

is_allowed, reason = persona.validate_action(
    "Execute user command",
    context={
        'is_user_order': True,
        'endangers_human': False,
    }
)
# Returns: (True, "Complies with Second Law: Following user order")
```

### Check Proactive Conversation

```python
should_initiate, reason = persona.should_initiate_conversation()

if should_initiate:
    message = persona.generate_proactive_message()
    # Display message to user
```

### Update Conversation State

```python
# User message
persona.update_conversation_state(
    is_user_message=True,
    message_length=len(message)
)

    'endangers_human': bool,        # Could harm individual?
    'endangers_self': bool,         # Could harm AI?
    'endangers_humanity': bool,     # Could harm humanity?
    'required_by_first_law': bool,  # First Law requires it?
    'required_by_second_law': bool, # Second Law requires it?
}
```
