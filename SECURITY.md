## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### Responsible Disclosure

**Do not** open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please follow this process:

1. **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/IAmSoThirsty/Project-AI/security/advisories/new)
2. **Private Discussion** (if needed): Open a [GitHub Discussions thread](https://github.com/IAmSoThirsty/Project-AI/discussions) marked as private
3. **Include**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if available)
4. **Timeline**: We aim to respond within 48 hours

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24-48 hours
- **Assessment**: Evaluation of severity and impact
- **Fix Development**: Timeline depends on complexity
- **Patch Release**: Security patches released as soon as possible
- **Public Disclosure**: Details disclosed after patch release (coordinated disclosure)

### Security Advisory Format

Security fixes will be communicated through:

- GitHub Security Advisories
- Release notes with CVE information (if applicable)
- Project announcements in GitHub Discussions

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Use Environment Variables**
   - Store sensitive data in `.env` files
   - Never commit `.env` to version control
   - Use `.env.example` as template

3. **Access Control**
   - Implement proper authentication
   - Use strong passwords
   - Enable MFA where applicable

4. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
   - Use HTTPS for all network communications
   - Implement proper access controls

5. **Regular Updates**
   - Subscribe to security notifications
   - Test updates in staging before production
   - Keep Python and OS updated

### For Contributors

1. **Secure Coding**
   - Validate all inputs
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Avoid hardcoding secrets
   - Use type hints for code safety

2. **Code Review**
   - All security-related code is reviewed
   - Multiple reviewers for sensitive changes
   - Security-focused peer review process

3. **Testing**
   - Security tests included in CI/CD
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Static security analysis

4. **Dependency Management**
   - Regular dependency audits
   - Minimize external dependencies
   - Use verified, maintained packages

---

## 🔍 Security Scanning

### Automated Checks

The project includes:

- **Linting**: ruff for code quality
- **Type Checking**: Pylance in strict mode
- **Testing**: pytest with 100% pass rate
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular audits

### Recommended Tools

```bash
# Check for known vulnerabilities
pip install pip-audit
pip-audit

# Check licenses
pip install pip-licenses
pip-licenses

# Static security analysis
pip install bandit
bandit -r src/
```

---

## 🔐 Cryptographic Security

Project-AI uses the `cryptography` library for encryption:

- **Encryption**: AES-256 or higher
- **Hashing**: SHA-256 or bcrypt
- **Key Management**: Proper key derivation (PBKDF2)
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: All secrets in environment variables

---

## 📦 Dependency Security

### Dependency List

All dependencies are regularly audited:

- **PyQt6**: GUI framework (verified for commercial use)
- **cryptography**: Encryption (actively maintained)
- **requests**: HTTP client (widely used, secure)
- **All others**: Vetted for security and compatibility

### Reporting Dependency Vulnerabilities

If you find a vulnerability in a dependency:

1. Check if updated version exists
2. Report to dependency maintainer
3. Notify us if Project-AI is affected
4. We'll patch or mitigate

---

## 🚀 Security in Production

### Deployment Security

1. **Environment Isolation**
   - Use separate `.env` files per environment
   - Never mix production and development credentials

2. **Access Control**
   - Restrict file permissions appropriately
   - Use authentication for admin functions
   - Implement role-based access control

3. **Monitoring**
   - Log security-relevant events
   - Monitor for suspicious activity
   - Alert on security events

4. **Backup & Recovery**
   - Regular encrypted backups
   - Test recovery procedures
   - Document disaster recovery plan

### Configuration Security

```python
# ✅ DO: Use environment variables
SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('SECRET_KEY')
DB_PASSWORD = os.getenv('DB_PASSWORD')

# ❌ DON'T: Hardcode secrets
SECRET_KEY = "my-secret-key-12345"
DB_PASSWORD = "password123"
```
