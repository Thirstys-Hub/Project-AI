## Known Issues

### Stylistic Warnings (Non-blocking)

Some IDE analysis tools report stylistic warnings about placeholder `__init__` methods, even though:

- All methods contain initialization code
- All methods are properly documented
- All code is syntactically valid
- All imports work correctly
- All type checking passes

These are cosmetic warnings and do not affect functionality.

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Next Session)

1. [ ] Monitor for any runtime issues with agent modules
2. [ ] Review placeholder implementations for completion opportunities
3. [ ] Run full test suite if available

### Short-term (Week 1-2)

1. [ ] Complete agent implementations with actual functionality
2. [ ] Add unit tests for agent modules
3. [ ] Create integration tests for intelligence_engine.py

### Medium-term (Month 1)

1. [ ] Split `ai_systems.py` into focused modules
2. [ ] Consolidate security modules
3. [ ] Performance optimization

### Long-term (Ongoing)

1. [ ] Refactor for better separation of concerns
2. [ ] Implement additional agent features
3. [ ] Enhance documentation and examples
